Project Description: A* Search for the 15-Puzzle

1. Overview and Objective

This project implements the A* (pronounced "A-Star") search algorithm to find the optimal (lowest-cost) solution path for the classic 15-Puzzle (the 4x4 sliding tile puzzle).

The primary objective is to demonstrate the understanding and correct application of heuristic search techniques. The solution must guarantee optimality, meaning the A* algorithm must find a path with the minimum number of moves from the initial state to the goal state.

2. Problem Formulation: The 15-Puzzle

The 15-Puzzle is modeled as a state-space search problem:

State: The configuration of the 15 numbered tiles and the single empty space (represented by 0) on the 4x4 grid.

Initial State: The starting configuration of the puzzle provided to the search algorithm.

Goal State: The sorted configuration:

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15  0


Actions (Operators): Moving any tile horizontally or vertically adjacent to the empty slot into the empty slot.

Cost: Every move (action) has a uniform cost of 1.

3. Algorithm: A* Search

A* search is an informed, best-first search algorithm that combines the benefits of uniform-cost search and pure heuristic search. It evaluates each node $n$ using the cost function $f(n)$:

$$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$$

$g(n)$ (Cost to Reach): The actual cost of the path from the start node to the current node $n$. In the 15-Puzzle, this is the number of moves made so far.

$h(n)$ (Heuristic Cost): The estimated minimum cost of the path from the current node $n$ to the goal state.

The algorithm explores nodes in order of increasing $f(n)$, prioritizing paths that are both short and appear promising based on the heuristic. The use of an admissible and consistent heuristic ensures that the first goal node found is the optimal one.

Heuristic Function (Manhattan Distance)

For the 15-Puzzle, the chosen heuristic is the Manhattan Distance ($h(n)$), implemented in the FifteensNode.evaluate_heuristic() method.

The Manhattan Distance is calculated as the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances of every tile (excluding the empty slot) from its correct goal position.

$$h(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{15} (\text{Distance}_{row} + \text{Distance}_{column} \text{ for tile } i)$$

This heuristic is:

Admissible: It never overestimates the true cost to the goal (since moving a tile one step closer to its goal position costs at least 1, and the Manhattan distance counts only the minimum number of steps required).

Consistent: It satisfies the triangle inequality, which further guarantees that A* will find the optimal solution efficiently.

4. Implementation Structure

The project code is divided into three key areas of responsibility:

search.py: Houses the abstract A* search logic, utilizing a min-heap (heapq) as the priority queue to select the node with the lowest $f(n)$ value.

node.py: Provides the base class (Node) for the search space, managing attributes like parent, g (path cost), f (total estimated cost), and the abstract methods required for A* (e.g., is_goal, evaluate_heuristic).

problems.py: Contains the concrete implementation for the FifteensNode, defining the problem-specific logic:

Parsing the input board.

Defining the goal state.

Implementing the movement logic in generate_children.

Implementing the Manhattan Distance heuristic in evaluate_heuristic.
